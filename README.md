# Pneumococcus-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Detecting Pneumococcus Disease is a crucial task within the medical field, given its significant impact on patient outcomes when identified early. Machine learning
 (ML) techniques offer promising avenues for aiding in the diagnosis of this disease. This research presents an ML model designed to leverage a dataset containing
 patient symptoms and laboratory test results for pneumococcus detection. The model employs feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features,
 enhancing its predictive capability. Utilizing a classification algorithm, the model predicts the presence of the disease with high accuracy. The proposed model is
 trained using the Inception V3 algorithm and validated using a random test dataset. Evaluation of the model’s performance is conducted using the accuracy metric, re
vealing a maximum detection accuracy of 96.2 percentage. These results underscore the model’s remarkable accuracy and its potential as an effective diagnostic tool for pneumococcus Disease. Medical professionals stand to benefit significantly from the implementation of this model, as it can aid in the timely and accurate diagnosis of the disease, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. By leveraging ML techniques, healthcare providers can enhance their diagnostic capabilities, providing more effective treatment strategies and improving overall patient care.
